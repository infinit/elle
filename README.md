dOpenSSL
========

The [**dOpenSSL**](http://github.com/infinit/dopenssl) library extends the OpenSSL
Project cryptographic library so as to provide deterministic random generation
functionalities. Basically, dOpenSSL guarantees that should a big number or a
cryptographic key be generated, given a PNRG's state, the result would be always
the same.

The OpenSSL random generator introduces entropy in many places, making it
unusable in a deterministic way. Thus, some functions have been cloned and
adapted in order to guarantee determinism.

This product includes software developed by the OpenSSL Project for use
in the OpenSSL Toolkit. (http://www.openssl.org/)

Sources
-------

Retrieve the dOpenSSL sources on Github as follows

```Shell
$> git clone git://github.com/infinit/dopenssl.git
```

Build
-----

First of all, go to the directory containing the dOpenSSL's sources:

```Shell
$> cd dopenssl/
```

Here you will find all the sources, tests and samples related to dOpenSSL.
Then, go to the build directory related to your machine's operating system and
architecture. All the build directories are located in `_build/`.

For the purpose of this tutorial, we will assume your machine runs a Linux
64-bit operating system.

```Shell
$> cd _build/linux64/
```

There are two ways for building dOpenSSL. The first relies on the
[Drake](http://github.com/infinit/drake) build system (which must be installed
on your system) with which dOpenSSL has been developed. The other way
consists in invoking a simple Makefile (generated by Drake).

### Drake

Assuming Drake has been installed on your system and is referenced in the
`PYTHONPATH` environment variable, simply invoke the `//build` rule so as to
compile and generate the dOpenSSL library.

```Shell
$> ./drake //build
Compile sources/dopenssl/rand.o
Compile sources/dopenssl/bn.o
Compile sources/dopenssl/rsa.o
Link lib/libdopenssl.a
Link lib/libdopenssl.so
$>
```

Alternatively, one may want to invoke the drake script with a specific python
binary, so as to use the latest python version for instance:

```Shell
$> python3.2 ./drake //build
```

At this point, the dOpenSSL library has been built successfully.

### Make

Simply invoke the Makefile's `build` rule as follows:

```Shell
$> make build
```

Test
----

Making sure the dOpenSSL library has been properly built and behaves as expected
on your system is important.

Note that the following assumes your are still in the `_build/linux64/`
directory.

### Drake

Just invoke the `//check` rule which will both compile the tests and run them.

```Shell
$> ./drake //check
Compile tests/dopenssl/rsa.o
Compile tests/dopenssl/rand.o
Compile tests/dopenssl/bn.o
Link tests/dopenssl/rsa
Link tests/dopenssl/rand
Link tests/dopenssl/bn
Run tests/dopenssl/rsa
Run tests/dopenssl/rand
Run tests/dopenssl/bn
$>
```

### Make

Likewise, invoke the `check` rule so as to run the tests.

```Shell
$> make check
```

Install
-------

Installing dOpenSSL on your system is as simple as the previous steps.

### Drake

Invoke the `//install` rule so as to copy the library files on your system.
Note that the `--prefix` option can be passed so as to specify the destination
directory.

The example below install the dOpenSSL library in `$HOME/local/` with the
header files in `$HOME/local/include/` and the library files in
`$HOME/local/lib/`.

```Shell
$> ./drake //install --prefix=$HOME/local/
```

### Make

Once again, nothing could be simpler, the `install` rule make it extremely easy
to install the library files:

```Shell
$> make install
```

Note that you may need to be `root` in order to install the dOpenSSL library
in one of your system's directories.

Examples
--------

The following source code can be copied and pasted in a test file, say `test.c`.
This sample shows how dOpenSSL can be used to generate cryptographic keys ---
in this case 2048-bit RSA keys --- in a deterministic way i.e based on a given
passphrase. The program therefore assures that, given the same passphrase, the
exact same RSA key will be generated.

```C
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>

#include <dopenssl/rsa.h>
#include <dopenssl/rand.h>

int main(int argc, char **argv)
{
  if (argc != 2)
  {
    printf("usage: %s [passphrase]\n", argv[0]);
    return(1);
  }

  unsigned int const bits = 2048;

  char const* passphrase = argv[1];
  unsigned int const length = strlen(passphrase);
  unsigned int const size = bits / 8;
  unsigned int const occurences = size / length + 1;

  unsigned char* seed = malloc(occurences * length + 1);
  memset(seed, 0x0, occurences * length + 1);

  /* Concatenate the passphrase so as to create a 256-byte buffer */
  unsigned int i;
  for (i = 0; i < occurences; i++)
    strncpy(seed + (i * length), passphrase, length);

  /* Initialize the deterministic random generator */
  if (dRAND_init() != 1)
  {
    printf("[error] unable to initialize the random generator\n");
    return (1);
  }

  /* Generate the RSA key */
  RSA* rsa = NULL;

  if ((rsa = dRSA_deduce_privatekey(bits, seed, size)) == NULL)
  {
    printf("[error] unable to generate the RSA key pair\n");
    return (1);
  }

  /* Display the RSA components */
  RSA_print_fp(stdout, rsa, 0);

  /* Clean the resources */
  if (dRAND_clean() != 1)
  {
    printf("[error] unable to clean the random generator\n");
    return (1);
  }

  return (0);
}
```

Assuming the dOpenSSL library has been installed in `$HOME/local/`, the sample
program can be compiled as follows:

```Shell
$> gcc -I $HOME/local/include -L $HOME/local/lib -ldopenssl -lcrypto test.c -o test
```

Note that you may need to add the library directory where OpenSSL has been
installed e.g `/usr/lib/`, `/opt/local/lib/` etc.

```Shell
$> gcc -I $HOME/local/include -L $HOME/local/lib -L /opt/local/lib -ldopenssl -lcrypto test.c -o test
```

Then, in order to launch the program, you may need to specify your system where
to look for libraries, again assuming dOpenSSL has been installed in
`$HOME/local/`:

```Shell
$> export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$HOME/local/lib:${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}
```

Finally, just launch the sample program by providing a passphrase:

```Shell
$> ./test "chiche donne nous tout"
Private-Key: (2048 bit)
modulus:

```

Note that you should get exactly the same output since dOpenSSL guarantees the
result is deterministic.

Dependencies
------------

The library relies upon the following libraries:

 * [**OpenSSL**](http://www.openssl.org) which provides the fundamental cryptographic operations.

Internals
---------

The library is composed of a three components, all required for ensuring the
determinism of the cryptography key generation mechanism.

First, a deterministic random implementation is provided, referred to as dRAND.

Although this implementation is deterministic, determinism must also be assured
at the BIGNUM level because some of the functions introduce entroy, the ones
related to `BN_generate_prime_ex()` for instance.

Finally a set of functions for deducing a private/public key from a PRNG state
in a deterministic way is provided for every asymmetric cryptosystem, such as
RSA.

In other words, some of the OpenSSL library's functions have been slightly
modified so as to remove the operations destined at adding entropy, especially
the ones based on uninitialized variables.

The reader interested in looking at these slight modifications can look around
for "PATCHED".
