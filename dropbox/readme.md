# AWS: reactorified Dropbox API

The Dropbox library provides a *reactorification* for the [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/developers) API.

This library is part of the [Elle](https://github.com/infinit/elle) set of libraries.

## Motivation

To demonstrate capabilities of our [file system](https://github.com/infinit/fs) interface used by our storage platform, we've created a wrapper for the Dropbox web API using the [reactor](/reactor).

## How to compile

_See [Elle: How to compile](https://github.com/infinit/elle#how-to-compile)._

```bash
./drake //dropbox/build -j 2
```
